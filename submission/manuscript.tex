\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

(Modify depending on target journal, currently abstract submitted to
World Microbe Forum) Antibiotics are a major risk factor for
\emph{Clostridioides difficile} infections (CDIs) because of their
impact on the intestinal microbiome. However, non-antibiotic medications
such as the ubiquitous osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350,
also alter the microbiota, but whether PEG impacts CDI susceptibility
and clearance is unclear. To examine how PEG impacts susceptibility, we
treated C57Bl/6 mice with 5-day and 1-day doses of 15\% PEG in the
drinking water and then challenged the mice with \emph{C. difficile} 630
spores. We used clindamycin-treated mice as a control because they
consistently clear \emph{C. difficile} within 10 days post-infection
(dpi). To examine how PEG treatment impacts clearance, we administered
PEG for 1 day to clindamycin-treated, \emph{C. difficile}-challenged
mice either immediately following challenge or 3 dpi. We collected
longitudinal stool samples to examine \emph{C. difficile} levels in the
stool via anaerobic culture and profiled the microbiota by 16S rRNA
sequencing. PEG treatment alone was sufficient to render mice
susceptible to CDI and 5-day PEG-treated mice remain colonized for up to
30 dpi. Additionally, 5-day PEG treated mice remained susceptible to CDI
10-days post treatment. In contrast, 1-day PEG treated mice were
transiently colonized, clearing \emph{C. difficile} within 7 dpi.
Although 5-day PEG-treated mice exhibited prolonged \emph{C. difficile}
colonization, we saw no difference in histological inflammation between
PEG- and clindamycin-treated mice. Additionally, administering PEG to
mice after \emph{C. difficile} challenge prolonged colonization up to 30
dpi in mice that received PEG immediately after challenge and 15 dpi in
mice that received PEG 3 dpi. When we examined microbiota composition
across our different treatment groups, we found decreased richness in
the PEG-treated mice that exhibited prolonged \emph{C. difficile}
colonization. Importantly, there were increased Bacteroides and
Enterobacteriaceae and decreased Lachnospiraceae and Oscillibacter in
most of the PEG-treated mice with prolonged \emph{C. difficile}
colonization. Our findings suggest the osmotic laxative PEG 3350 alters
the mouse microbiota and disrupts colonization resistance to \emph{C.
difficile}, as well as clearance in mice with a CDI. Considering that
most hospitals recommend not performing \emph{C. difficile} testing on
patients taking laxatives and laxatives are used when administering
fecal microbiota transplants via colonoscopy to patients with recurrent
CDIs, further studies are needed to evaluate if laxatives impact human
microbiota colonization resistance.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Medications have been shown to alter the intestinal microbiota, but
  how this may influence susceptibility to enteric infections is less
  clear.
\item
  The ubiquitous osmotic laxative, polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350
  (Miralax/Nulytely/Golytely) that is also commonly used as bowel
  preparation for colonoscopies (also one of the possible administration
  routes used for fecal microbiota transplantation, a therapy for
  recurrent C. difficile infection) has been shown to influence the
  intestinal microbiota and mucosal barrier.
\item
  Review of previous mouse studies with PEG
\item
  2 main questions:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Does PEG 3350 prolong colonization and result in more severe C.
    difficile infections?
  \item
    How does PEG 3350 influence C. difficile clearance and fecal
    microbiota transplant (FMT) in mice?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item
  Discussion of prolonged persistence. C. difficile sequences detected
  in tissue samples. Association with mucin-degrading bacteria suggested
  by recent {[}a{[}ers{]}{]}
\item
  Discuss why we might not have observed more severe histology in PEG
  mice relative to clindamycin-treated mice

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Antibiotics may also impact mucus layer
  \item

  \end{itemize}
\item
  Protective bacteria missing in PEG-treated mice
\item
  Discuss what these findings might mean for human patients

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    What's known regarding laxatives and susceptibility to CDIs
  \item
    Relevance to human FMTs? Unclear what the best administration route
    is because there have been no studies designed to evaluate the best
    administration route for FMTs.
