\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

(Modify depending on target journal, currently abstract submitted to
World Microbe Forum) Antibiotics are a major risk factor for
\emph{Clostridioides difficile} infections (CDIs) because of their
impact on the intestinal microbiome. However, non-antibiotic medications
such as the ubiquitous osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350,
also alter the microbiota, but whether PEG impacts CDI susceptibility
and clearance is unclear. To examine how PEG impacts susceptibility, we
treated C57Bl/6 mice with 5-day and 1-day doses of 15\% PEG in the
drinking water and then challenged the mice with \emph{C. difficile} 630
spores. We used clindamycin-treated mice as a control because they
consistently clear \emph{C. difficile} within 10 days post-infection
(dpi). To examine how PEG treatment impacts clearance, we administered
PEG for 1 day to clindamycin-treated, \emph{C. difficile}-challenged
mice either immediately following challenge or 3 dpi. We collected
longitudinal stool samples to examine \emph{C. difficile} levels in the
stool via anaerobic culture and profiled the microbiota by 16S rRNA
sequencing. PEG treatment alone was sufficient to render mice
susceptible to CDI and 5-day PEG-treated mice remain colonized for up to
30 dpi. Additionally, 5-day PEG treated mice remained susceptible to CDI
10-days post treatment. In contrast, 1-day PEG treated mice were
transiently colonized, clearing \emph{C. difficile} within 7 dpi.
Although 5-day PEG-treated mice exhibited prolonged \emph{C. difficile}
colonization, we saw no difference in histological inflammation between
PEG- and clindamycin-treated mice. Additionally, administering PEG to
mice after \emph{C. difficile} challenge prolonged colonization up to 30
dpi in mice that received PEG immediately after challenge and 15 dpi in
mice that received PEG 3 dpi. When we examined microbiota composition
across our different treatment groups, we found decreased richness in
the PEG-treated mice that exhibited prolonged \emph{C. difficile}
colonization. Importantly, there were increased Bacteroides and
Enterobacteriaceae and decreased Lachnospiraceae and Oscillibacter in
most of the PEG-treated mice with prolonged \emph{C. difficile}
colonization. Our findings suggest the osmotic laxative PEG 3350 alters
the mouse microbiota and disrupts colonization resistance to \emph{C.
difficile}, as well as clearance in mice with a CDI. Considering that
most hospitals recommend not performing \emph{C. difficile} testing on
patients taking laxatives and laxatives are used when administering
fecal microbiota transplants via colonoscopy to patients with recurrent
CDIs, further studies are needed to evaluate if laxatives impact human
microbiota colonization resistance.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Antibiotics are a major risk factor for \emph{Clostridioides difficile}
infections (CDIs) because they disrupt microbiota colonization
resistance (1). However, antibiotics are not the only types of
medications that disrupt the microbiota (2--4). Although, other
medications (proton pump inhibitors, osmotic laxatives, antimotility
agents, and opioids) have been implicated as risk or protective factors
for CDIs through epidemiological studies, whether the association is due
to their impact on the microbiome is still unclear (5--9).

Many of the non-antibiotic medications associated with CDIs are known to
modulate gastrointestinal motility leading to either increased or
decreased colonic transit time, which in turn also strongly impacts
microbiota composition and function (10, 11). Stool consistency often
serves as an approximation of intestinal motility. Our group has shown
that when \emph{C. difficile} negative controls are separated into two
groups based on stool consistency, there are shared microbiota features
such as lower alpha diversity in samples from CDI patients and control
patients with diarrhea compared to control samples that were \emph{C.
difficile} negative with non-diarrheal consistency (12). These results
led to a hypothesis that bacterial communities from patients
experiencing diarrhea are susceptible to developing CDIs.

Osmotic laxatives can lead to diarrhea depending on the administered
dose and temporarily disrupt the human intestinal microbiota (13). The
ubiquitous osmotic laxative, polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 is found in
Miralax, Nulytely, and Golytely and is also commonly used as bowel
preparation for colonoscopies. Interestingly, previous studies have
shown that treating mice with PEG alone altered microbiota composition,
reduced acetate and butyrate production, altered the mucus barrier, and
rendered the mice susceptible to \emph{C. difficile} infection (14--17).
The mucus barrier is thought to mediate protection from \emph{C.
difficile} infections by protecting intestinal epithelial cells from the
toxins produced by \emph{C. difficile} (Ref). However, whether laxative
results in more severe CDIs in mice and how long mice remain colonized
with \emph{C. difficile} after challenge is unclear.

Beyond susceptibility, PEG is also relevant in the context of treating
recurrent CDIs via fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) where a healthy
microbiota is administered to the patient to restore colonization. For
FMTs that are delivered via colonoscopy, patients typically undergo
bowel preparation by taking an osmotic laxative prior to the procedure.
Many of the FMT studies to date rationalize the use of laxatives (Ref)
based on a 1996 case study with 2 pediatric patients where the authors
suggested in the discussion that the laxative may help flush \emph{C.
difficile} spores and toxins from the intestine (18).

In the past, our group has used C57BL6 mice to characterize how
antibiotics including clindamycin disrupt the microbiota and influence
\emph{C. difficile} susceptibility and clearance {[}ref{]}. Although,
two groups have now shown PEG treatment alone renders mice susceptible
to \emph{C. difficile}, these studies have raised additional questions
regarding the dynamics and severity of infection as well as the role of
laxative treatment in \emph{C. difficile} clearance that should be
addressed to better inform how we think about laxatives in the context
of CDIs. Here, we used our C57BL/6 clindamycin model as a control group
to characterize how long PEG-treated mice remain susceptible, whether
PEG treatment results in more severe CDI and sustained \emph{C.
difficile} colonization, and if PEG treatment post-CDI can promote
\emph{C. difficile} clearance.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results}}

\textbf{5-day laxative treatment leads to prolonged \emph{C. difficile}
colonization in mice.} We compared mice treated with the osmotic
laxative PEG 3350 to our standard 10 mg/kg clindamycin treatment, which
temporarily renders the mice susceptible to \emph{C. difficile}, with
mice typically clearing \emph{C. difficile} within 10 days
post-infection (9, 19). All PEG-treated mice were administered a 15\%
PEG solution in the drinking water for 5-days, one group was also
treated with clindamycin, and one group was allowed to recover for 10
days prior to challenge (Fig. 1A). PEG treatment resulted in weight loss
in all 3 groups of PEG-treated mice, with the greatest change in weight
observed on the fifth day of PEG treatment and the mice regained most of
the weight five days after treatment (Fig. 1B). After either PEG,
clindamycin, or PEG and clindamycin treatment all mice were challenged
with 10\textsuperscript{3} \emph{C. difficile} 630 spores. All
treatments rendered mice susceptible to \emph{C. difficile} colonization
(Fig. 1C), however PEG-treated mice remained colonized at a high level
through thirty days post-infection. In contrast, the clindamycin-treated
mice that cleared \emph{C. difficile} within ten days post-infection.
Surprisingly, PEG-treated mice were still susceptible to \emph{C.
difficile} infection after 10-days of recovery from treatment although
\emph{C. difficile} was not detectable in most of the group in the
initial five days post-infection (Fig. 1C). From 9 days post-infection
onward, the median \emph{C. difficile} stabilized for the 5-day PEG plus
10-day recovery group of mice and remained high through 30 days
post-infection (Fig. 1C). Thus, osmotic laxative treatment alone was
sufficient to render mice susceptible to prolonged \emph{C. difficile}
colonization and PEG-treated mice remained susceptible for up to ten
days post-treatment.

\textbf{5-day laxative treatment differentially disrupts the fecal
microbiota compared to clindamycin treatment.} Since laxatives and
clindamycin have previously been shown to disrupt the murine microbiota
(ref), we hypothesized the different \emph{C. difficile} colonization
dynamics between mice treated with laxatives versus clindamycin were due
to the two drugs having differential effects on the microbiota. We
profiled the stool microbiota over time by sequencing the V4 region of
the 16S rRNA gene to compare changes across treatment groups. We found
time and treatment group explained half of the observed variation
between fecal communities with most of the remaining variation explained
by interactions between treatment group and other experimental variables
including time, cage effects, and sequencing preparation (PERMANOVA
combined R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.95, \emph{P} \textless{} 0.001, Fig.
2A, Data Set S1, Sheet X). Cage effects refer to the well-documented
phenomenon that mice housed in the same cages have similar microbial
communities due to copraphagy, we tried to minimize the impact of cage
effects on our experiment by breaking up cagemates when assigning mice
to treatment groups and primarily housing only two mice per cage.
Importantly, although we conducted a total of 5 separate experiments,
the experiment number and it's interaction with treatment group was not
one of the variables that significantly explained the observed variation
in fecal communities (Data Set S1, Sheet X). Interestingly, none of the
treatment groups recovered to their baseline community structure either
10 or 30 days post-infection suggesting other community features besides
recovery to baseline were responsible for the prolonged \emph{C.
difficile} colonization in PEG-treated mice (Fig. 2B). Next, we examined
alpha diversity by looking at Shannon diversity index over time,
although both clindamycin and PEG treatments decreased diversity, the
diversity index was lower in the groups of mice that received PEG
treatment compared to those that received clindamycin through thirty
days post-infection (Fig. 2C). We next examined the bacterial genera
that shifted after PEG treatment by comparing the baseline samples of
mice treated with only PEG to samples from the same mice one day
post-treatment. We found 18 OTUs that were altered by PEG, the majority
of these OTUs decreased after PEG, but \emph{Enterobacteriaceae} and
\emph{Bacteroides} increased and the increase in \emph{Bacteroides} was
unique to PEG treatment as Bacteroides actually decreased in clindamycin
treated mice (Fig. 2D). Finally, we examined the bacteria that differ
across treatment groups over multiple timepoints. We found\ldots{} (Fig.
2E). Thus, PEG has a significant impact on the fecal microbiota that was
maintained over time.

Surprisingly, \emph{C. difficile} was not immediately detectable in the
stools of the PEG-treated mice that were allowed to recover for 10 days
prior to challenge. We decided to examine what other bacteria were
changing during the post-infection period when \emph{C. difficile}
changed from undectable to detectable. Interestingly, we found \_\_\_
bacteria were shifting during the time period when C. difficile was
becoming detectable in the stools (Fig. S1)

\textbf{5-day laxative treatment does not promote more severe CDIs
despite altering the mucosal microbiota.} Given that previous work had
demonstrated that PEG treatment disrupts the mucus layer and alters the
immune response in mice (16), we decided to examine the impact of PEG
treatment on the mucosal microbiota and CDI severity. We examined CDI
severity by evaluating cecum and colon histopathology {[}{]}.

\textbf{\emph{C. difficile} challenge does not have a synergistic
disruptive effect on the microbiota of PEG-treated mice} Because
\emph{C. difficile} itself can have an impact on the microbiota (ref),
we also sequenced the tissue and stools of mock-challenged mice.
Examining the stools of the mock-infected PEG- and clindamycin-treated
mice revealed similar bacterial disruptions as the \emph{C. difficile}
challenged mice (Fig. S2A). Similarly, there was no difference between
the tissues of mock and \emph{C. difficile} challenged mice (Fig. S2B).
Thus, most of the microbiota alterations we observed in the PEG-treated
mice were a result of the laxative and not an interaction between the
laxative and \emph{C. difficile}.

\textbf{1-day laxative treatment results in transient \emph{C.
difficile} colonization and minor microbiota disruption} + Explain
motivation for experiment, set-up of experiment (Fig. 4A). + Transient
\emph{C. difficile} colonization in 1-day PEG treated mice with all PEG
mice clearing by 7dpi (Fig. 4B) + PCoA results (Day has larger R2 than
treatment group). PEG mice are closer to baseline communites after 7-day
period (Fig. 4C) + Shannon results show alpha diversity is only
transiently disrupted (Fig. 4D) + Highlight bacteria that are disrupted
by PEG or clindamycin treatment but recover within 7 days (Fig. 4E)

\textbf{Post-CDI laxative treatment disrupts clearance in
clindamycin-treated mice regardless of whether an FMT is also
administered} + Reiterate motivation for experiment. Saw only a
transient microbiota disruption with 1-day PEG treatment alone. Also,
see if adding FMT helps with clearance, mention groups have been using
PEG or Abx/PEG treatments as a tool to engraft mice with human bacteria
communities. Set up of experiment (Fig. 5A). + Prolonged \emph{C.
difficile} colonization in post-CDI PEG treated mice (Fig. 5B) + FMT
appears to partially restore alpha diversity (Shannon, but not richness
Fig. 5C-D) + PCoA (necessary?) Could comment on the clustering of
Clindamycin and PEG-treated mice that received FMT (Fig. 5E) + Only 2
genera significantly impacted by FMT treatment, likely not as important
for clearance (Fig. 5F) + Bacteria that consistently differ between
groups over time, associated with prolonged colonization (Fig. G)

will have prolonged \emph{C. difficile} colonization} After identifying
